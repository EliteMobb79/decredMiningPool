# Decred Micro Pool 

## What is this?
The current price of Decred has made it impossible for small investors and beginners to purchase tickets and vote in the future of Decred. The aim of this app is to pool the Decred of many uses together so that their purchasing power is large enough to influence the market. This also has the added advantage of allowing individual people to invest Decred they're not using and see stable returns over time.

## Pool Methods
There are several types of pools that can be created with this app, however they all will work in a similar way. The basic idea is that all Decred sent to the pool addresses will be used to purchase tickets on behalf of the users. When a ticket is called for voting the ticket will vote in the descision the majority of users preference. 

> As an example say the price per ticket is 100DCR and 500 people have deposited 300DCR into the pool. If 60% of them vote yes on a change and 40% vote no, 60% of the tickets should vote yes and 40% should vote no. Since in this example there are only 3 tickets, 2 of these tickets will vote yes and the other will vote no.

The amount of voting power an individual user has is proportional to the amount of Decred they deposit into the pool.

> If Sally deposits 30DCR into the pool when the price of a ticket is 100DCR then her vote will be worth 30% of one ticket.

> If Greg deposits 200DCR into the pool when the price of a ticket is 50DCR then his vote will be worth 400% of one ticket. Meaning that 4 tickets will vote for the option Greg chooses.
